# CaeserCipher

This is a JavaFX based application which builds a GUI encrypting text from files.
The encryption used is a simple Caesar cipher. 
In a Caesar cipher, each character in a message is shifted forwards or backwards on the ASCII/Unicode table based on a shift value. 
For this project, a shift value of 10 is to be used.
